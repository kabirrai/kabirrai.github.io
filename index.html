  <p> Hi! My name is Kabir Rai. I am an American of Indian origin.
    I was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey. At the age of 6 I moved from
    America to Switzerland. I lived in Zurich, Switzerland for four years. At the
    age of 10 I moved to Frankfurt,Germany. I lived there till the age of 12. From,
    Germany we move to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I lived there for six years and
    graduated from high school there.

    I then went to University in England. After completing my education I moved
    to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I stayed there for 10 months before moving to
    New Delhi, India. I've been working in New Delhi for over 7 years. I had my
    own marketing and communications company, where we did station and train branding.

    Now, I am here in Washingon DC, where I live with my brother. I am currently
    doing a Web Development Immersive at General Assembly. I hope to find a job
    in the DC area.
